					<h2>The Computers Identity</h2>
							<p>Three years,</br>Is all it takes to make a technician,</br>But no one ever knows,</br>No one ever realises,</br>The technician's identity,</br></br>Every morning,</br>The black box in my room beeps,</br>And it wakes up when I do,</br>The fans whir and spin up,</br>The loudest thing in my room,</br>Other than my alarm,</br></br>But it's identity,</br>It's name, age and hobbies,</br>Is generalised,</br>To everyone but me,</br></br>This isn't a romantic relationship,</br>With a man and his computer,</br>But more of a companionship,</br>Where man meets machine,</br></br>My machines identity is an unusual one,</br>Mine is called Goliath,</br>As a inside joke with another computer I built,</br>Called David,</br></br></br>David is the bigger of the two,</br>And is the less powerful one,</br>Goliath's identity changes on a regular basis,
</br>He is 3 years old,
</br>I got him and made him when I started uni,
</br></br>
Yet oddly enough,
</br>Goliath is a Christian,
</br>And somehow does better evangelism than I do,
</br>But everyone just assumes that I'm crazy,
</br></br>
That I'm just a whacky IT guy,
</br>But I'm not,
</br>If you think carefully,
</br>Everything has an identity,
</br></br>
I'm writing this on my phone,
</br>An expensive phone I have named JARVIS,
</br>Because it's my digital personal assistant,
</br>Even though it only works by sending pulses of electricity to other things that do the same,
</br></br>
</br>Identity if found in everything,
</br>I found my identity in computers,
</br>The things that build my passion and care,
</br>While I use that passion and care to build them,
</br></br>
But I'm not just a Technician,
</br>I am a Christian Technician,
</br>And that's the best kind of Technician,
</br>Because with God's power,
</br>I can be the best out there,
</br></br>
</br>With no identity,
</br>A computer is nothing,
</br>Yet with identity,
</br>A computer can be the small little box,
</br>That changes death to life,
</br></br>
The small little box,
</br>That brings joy to millions,
</br>A small little box,
</br>That gets abused,
</br>
</br>Does this not sound familiar?
</br>Something or someone that brings joy to millions?
</br>And something or someone that gets abused?
</br>
</br>I treat my computers,
</br>The same way I treat people around me,
</br>Because the world needs love,
</br>
</br>Computer's don't have feelings,
</br>And maybe they will one day,
</br>But think about one thing,
</br>Would you treat your loved ones the same way you treat your computers?
</br>Because even though they don't have feelings,
</br>Computers have an identity.</p>
